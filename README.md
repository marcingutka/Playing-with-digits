# Playing-with-digits
Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p. We want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such as the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k * n. If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1. n and p will always be given as strictly positive integers.
